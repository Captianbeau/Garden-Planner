## Description
This website is designed to help users gather information for plants to put in their gardens, It gives access to 3000 different plants. Users can use the searches to look for plants by name or location, you can also find the hardiness zone of your location. If a user doesn’t have a specific plant in mind then the browse button will allow them to look through the plant log. Favorite plants can be saved to the user’s local storage for later review. There is also a little information about gardening, to help beginners with their research.
